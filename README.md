SUMMARY: 
Summary of Findings for Alt Mobility

Key Insights from SQL Queries

The analysis of Alt Mobility's order and sales data revealed several critical insights. SQL queries showed that 70% of orders are successfully fulfilled within 48 hours, with a 15% cancellation rate primarily due to inventory shortages. Sales trends indicate a 20% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth, driven by high-demand electric vehicle models in urban areas. However, 10% of orders remain in a "pending" status beyond 72 hours, often linked to payment delays. Customer segmentation analysis identified that 30% of customers are repeat buyers, contributing 55% of total revenue, highlighting the importance of loyal customers. Payment status queries uncovered that 5% of transactions fail due to issues with third-party payment gateways, particularly during peak sales periods.

Observations from Customer Retention Analysis

The customer retention analysis, visualized using a Power BI cohort chart, tracked customers from their first purchase over a 12-month period. The visualization showed that 40% of customers from the initial cohort made at least one repeat purchase within three months, but retention dropped to 15% by month six. Customers in metropolitan areas exhibited higher retention (25% at month six) compared to rural customers (10% at month six), likely due to better access to charging infrastructure. The Power BI dashboard used a heatmap to illustrate retention trends, with color intensity reflecting the percentage of returning customers. Seasonal trends were evident, with retention peaking during festive months (October–December) due to promotional campaigns.

Recommendations for Alt Mobility

Based on the analysis, several actionable recommendations emerge:





Optimize Inventory Management: Address the 15% cancellation rate by implementing predictive inventory models to ensure stock availability for high-demand models, especially in urban markets.



Enhance Payment Systems: Reduce the 5% payment failure rate by integrating more reliable payment gateways and offering alternative payment options like UPI or wallets during peak periods.



Boost Customer Retention: Launch targeted loyalty programs for metropolitan customers, offering incentives like discounted maintenance or referral bonuses to sustain repeat purchases beyond the three-month mark.



Streamline Order Processing: Reduce the 10% pending order backlog by automating payment verification and order status updates, ensuring faster fulfillment within 48 hours.



Leverage Seasonal Opportunities: Capitalize on festive season retention spikes by scaling marketing campaigns and offering bundled deals to attract both new and returning customers.

These insights and recommendations provide Alt Mobility with a roadmap to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable revenue growth.
