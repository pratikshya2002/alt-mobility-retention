Customer Retention Analysis – Alt Mobility
Business Problem: 
This project is all about understanding how often customers come back to do business with us, using a technique called cohort analysis. We’ve looked at customer order data to see how many of them returned in the months or years after their first order.
SQL Files:
-Analysis.sql 
-Cohortreport.png
How to Use These Files:
Run the scripts one by one in your SQL system, making sure it’s connected to the Alt Mobility dataset.
