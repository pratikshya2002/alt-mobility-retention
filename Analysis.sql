 -- 5. Customer Retention Analysis â€“ Plan & Explanation
 -- Step 1: Determine the month of the first order per customer
WITH first_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    MIN(DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-01')) AS cohort_month
  FROM customerorders
  GROUP BY customer_id
),

-- Step 2: Link all orders to the customer's cohort
orders_with_cohort AS (
  SELECT 
    o.customer_id,
    DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m-01') AS order_month,
    f.cohort_month
  FROM customerorders o
  JOIN first_orders f ON o.customer_id = f.customer_id
)

-- Step 3: Count customers by cohort and how many made orders in subsequent months
SELECT
  cohort_month,
  order_month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS active_customers
FROM orders_with_cohort
GROUP BY cohort_month, order_month
ORDER BY cohort_month, order_month;
